       <p>Happy Valley Shelter has been finding safe and loving homes for dogs in the Piedmont area since 1989. We work in cooperation with local county shelters and rescue organizations and specialize in caring for neglected and abandoned dogs.
   <p>At Happy Valley, our staff are trained in all aspects of animal welfare and can give you expert advice on adoption, training, and care. We are proud of the work we do at Happy Valley and are grateful to our community for their support in helping us achieve our mission.</p>
<p>We take great care in matching each dog with the right family to ensure a successful adoption. We believe that every dog deserves a loving home, and we work tirelessly to make that a reality.</p>
